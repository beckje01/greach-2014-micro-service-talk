#Experiences using Grails in a micro service architechture

We deployed five new Grails micro services into production roughly 6 months ago. I will describe how Grails fits into our larger polyglot architecture. And go through our experiences building and maintaining these micro services. Showing what items we reused and standardized across the application, and the pitfalls we have encountered. I will also touch on some of the supporting technologies including Puppet, Vagrant, OpenStack, Spring Integration, and ActiveMQ; as well as how they interact with Grails.

By the end of the talk you should have the knowledge to evaluate if Grails micro services are good for your team and what support you will need to put in place before you can take the micro service approach.
